> To achieve auto-parsing, there was some workaround needed. As a result, the marketplace evaluation by the Logseq team may take a little longer.

# Overview

This super simple plugin uses NLP to parse your content for dates and times so that they can be easily tracked through your yournal pages.

## Auto Inline Parsing

As per the video, use `%enable auto-parsing%` to turn on auto parsing (off by default) and `%disable auto-parsing%` to turn it off.

Or, you can just use the hotkey combination `a p` to toggle auto-parsing on and off.
